	<article>
		<p>This publication, modest in appearance and extension, compared to those previously issued by our group--now known as Redes de Tutoría—is particularly relevant at the present moment in Mexico, in order to advance faster in the educational change that has already taken root among many teachers of small rural public schools. The publication vividly embodies, through recorded testimonials, the personal and social changes experienced and voiced by alumni, students, teachers and family members who taught and learned--all of them--in tutorial relationships. Their achievements are truly remarkable, because they occurred in ordinary, even supposedly adverse, settings, with the help of not particularly expert teachers, and without additional teaching technologies or materials. What was decisive was that the personal interest of each learner matched the care and knowledge of her/his tutor. The matching of interest and capacity ensured the success of the endeavor and, in addition, became the basic bond within communities of teachers and learners. 
</p><br>
		<p>The driving force of what can be described as a movement has been the newly found professional autonomy of teachers, who traditionally find themselves limited by institutional distrust and the ensuing overregulation and control. The experience of being attended to in regular training sessions, and of being asked to decide by themselves the topic of study each one wants to pursue, engaging in dialogue with friendly and knowledgeable tutors, renewed in them the joy of teaching and learning in freedom. They each chose a particular aspect of the program, because it was of real interest to them, or because they had never really mastered it; they explored it at their own pace, and in their own way as never before. All of this took place in constant dialogue with an interested, trusted and kind tutor. Moreover, the satisfaction of personal achievement increased as teachers reflected on the way they had learned.  They then shared their experiences with others and--in order to affirm and prove the worth of what they had learned--became tutors of the same topics to other teachers- apprentices.</p><br>
		
		<p>What teaching and learning in tutorial networks demonstrate is that the culture of school and the problem of change, as Seymour Sarason (2004) put it, is more related to ethical rather than to technical aspects.  They are more about personal, honest and truthful relationships than about programs, teacher-student ratios, material resources or state-of-the-art technologies. Paradoxically, what prevents the normal encounter of interested learners with caring and honest tutors is the traditional structure of a system in which learning is made a function of programs, schedules and methods decided by an external authority, rather than by the learners themselves. In a learning community, by contrast, content, times and methods are transformed into functions of what the learner and the tutor need, and are capable of doing. Experience shows that this simple, common sense approach goes against the grain of accepted practice in most schools. Therefore, we feel obliged to explain and promote this practice, which is satisfactory for students, teachers, parents and, indeed, for society at large. The best, most productive way to disseminate the practice has been by contagion, by participation in a learning community, becoming apprentices and wholeheartedly experiencing the tutorial cycle. In this publication, we offer a second best: the vicarious experience of the transformative nature of teaching and learning in tutorial networks, in videos and recorded interviews of people who manifest and explain their deep personal, emotional and intellectual transformation through the practice. </p><br>

     		<h3>Tutoring and learning communities in public multi-grade schools (1997-2018)</h3>
     		<p>
     			Tutoring and learning communities (Redes de Tutoría) in public schools began as an experiment, more than 20 years ago, in the small towns of Mexico, where the National Council for the Promotion of Education (CONAFE) opened Post-Primary centers (Cámara, 2003); a long overdue service, since only pre- and elementary school levels were usually offered in those places.

     		<h3>Trials of innovators</h3>
     		<p>
     			Trying to introduce an innovation in basic public and compulsory education faces a double challenge from the start: persuading the administrators of the service, of course; but more to the point, satisfying the felt needs of operators in the field: the teachers obviously, but also the students, even if their needs are not as manifest as those of the teachers.

     		<h3>Testimonials from people who experienced tutoría </h3>
     		<p>
     			Our task has been the relentless promotion of a different type of relationship between teachers and students in basic public schools. Tutoring is different from the standard classroom where one teacher is in charge of a large group of students, all bound to learn under his/her direction what a national program has decided.

     		<h3>Conviviality in the tutoría school community and beyond</h3><br>
     		<p>
     			The institution of school represents the most important medium in the formation of a community’s most valuable resource: its children and young people. In fact, a challenge has been planted at a global level to promote autonomy, the development of thinking and action, to learn to live with others harmoniously, and collaborative work as a way to improve the quality of learning that is meaningful and consequential. Towards these ends, experts have developed theories, programs, and curricular reforms from different angles that intend to make the ancient apparatus of school work. Nevertheless, the educational reality is evidence that these efforts are insufficient to improve the quality of education.

     		<h3>Learning autonomy or “learning to learn” in the tutoría classroom and beyond</h3><br>
     		<p>
     			Learning autonomy or “learning to learn” entails the ability to “learn how to think; to inquire about diverse phenomena, their causes and consequences; to control one’s personal learning processes; to assess learning together with others; and to develop an interest and motivation for lifelong learning.” (SEP, 2017, p.62). This competency is sometimes also called “lifelong learning” or “lifewide learning” to emphasize that it enables one to learn for life, across a variety of different contexts, with or without the direct support of a teacher (City, Elmore & Lynch, 2012).

     		<h3>Psychosocial abilities in tutoría</h3><br>
     		<p>
     			The majority of interviewees live in rural communities that have been plagued by poverty and weak social structures. Families are often affected by the migration of one or both parents, leaving children under the care of their  grandparents, uncles and aunts, or godparents. In these circumstances, aggression, difficulties in relating to others, and communication problems often arise. It is also common for students to feel pressured to leave school in order to work and support the family’s finances. As García (2016) points out, this generates personal frustration and the giving up of personal goals --an environment where people survive rather than thrive.

     		<h3>Cognitive abilities in tutoría</h3><br>
     		<p>
     			Each one of us constructs learning from our interactions with the outside world and with ourselves; learning is the product of inner reflection --conscious or unconscious-- that creates and strengthens so-called synaptic pathways. Neuroscience points out the role emotions play in learning --students who experience trust, safeness, and joy have a greater chance of building lasting learning than those deprived of such feelings (Willis, 2014). Every tutoría teacher strives to create a relationship with her students where she can cognitively challenge them and also welcome their feelings of puzzlement, frustration, and satisfaction that occur along the learning process.
