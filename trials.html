		<p>Trying to introduce an innovation in basic public and compulsory education faces a double challenge from the start: persuading the administrators of the service, of course; but more to the point, satisfying the felt needs of operators in the field: the teachers obviously, but also the students, even if their needs are not as manifest as those of the teachers. The two challenges run on two different negotiating tracks, given the vertical, rather authoritarian nature of public centralized services. Vis &agrave; vis the authorities, the promoters of the innovation cannot count only on the educational merits of their proposal, since policy decisions depend on other factors, notably public pressure and the expected political gains to functionaries and policy makers. As for teachers and students, used as they are to obeying decisions from above, a new practice will be truly innovative to the extent that they experience in themselves, independently of its official character, the transformative nature of what is imposed on them. In sum, the promoters address their proposal to students, through the mediation of their teachers, assuming the approving nod of the administrators, the gatekeepers. The promoters must have tested their innovation formally or informally, with or without official approval, and be thoroughly convinced of its merits, but they have to dialogue with gatekeepers on unequal rational grounds. Given, for the sake of argument, that the right political, social and financial conditions obtain, the decision makers would more often than not decide on an innovation by what they personally know of the technical competence and moral standards of its proponents, rather than by an independent and objective examination. The personal is political, as they say.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first large-scale introduction of teaching and learning in tutorial networks took place 22 years ago in the National Council for the Promotion of Education (CONAFE for its capitals in Spanish). This institution provides preschool and elementary services in thousands of remote, small rural communities, but not middle school which by then had become an integral part, by law, of public basic education. The need to provide middle school services in small communities led the then director of CONAFE, Edmundo Salas, to harken back to a previous innovation designed to ensure--bypassing the regular system--the graduation of elementary school drop-outs. The rather unorthodox approach of that program happened to be germane in spirit and outlook to that of the CONAFE director. The new experiment, called Rural Post-Primary, greatly benefited from having such a gatekeeper. Then, the challenge centered on making attractive the Post-Primary to elementary school graduates, recent and not-so-recent, who had to choose either to take up full time subsistence activities or to continue engaged, though part time, in school work. Since prospective students of Post-Primary in small communities do not enjoy the social, economic and family support to go to school that their urban counterparts take for granted, the core of the innovation was to ensure that the service accommodate in content and mode to students&rsquo; learning interests and idiosyncrasies: anything but forcing them to accommodate to the regular program and mode of middle urban schools. This basic postulate became operative by allowing students to choose from the offerings of the instructor what was of interest to them, assuming that the instructor would find, in tutorial dialogue, the particular way to help each student learn and achieve mastery of the elected subject matter. The counterpart to the freedom to choose study subjects was that instructors should offer only what they knew well, even if the official program indicated otherwise. This radical departure from standard practices demonstrated the centrality--in any learning situation--of the premise that the interest of the apprentice match the capacity and commitment of the tutor. However, having passed the gate and made the service responsive to individual interests, the Post-Primary had to demonstrate its right to modify established practices. The obvious criterion to evaluate an innovation is to see if the proposed objective was indeed achieved. In the case of the Post-Primary, it very soon became obvious that students were actively engaged, learning, demonstrating and sharing with others what they had freely chosen and learned in dialogue with the tutor. This common sense test should have been enough, no matter how incipient, to prove the worth of the innovation, assuming that interest and engagement in dialogue is what education is all about; but for the larger school system the innovation had to pass the regular tests, mostly standard ones. The Post-Primary did fairly well in those tests, even if students had not followed the weekly dosages of the official program, proving the motto that &ldquo;less is more&rdquo;: fewer subjects but fully explored and assimilated. Since it was supported as part of a World Bank loan, the Post-Primary passed an additional qualitative evaluation by an outsider, David Turner, who suggested improvements but thoroughly applauded and recommended the innovation (C&aacute;mara, 2003). Alas, just when the Post-Primary had passed conventional tests with fairly flying colors (according to the World Bank it was &ldquo;perhaps the most successful pilot of the program"), the arrival of new gatekeepers in CONAFE, with different policy priorities and impervious to rational argument, abruptly put an end to the innovation that by then had reached 470 community centers in 31 states.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The short lived Post-Primary innovation, now enriched with bitter-sweet CONAFE experiences, soon found a place where to migrate: the subsystem of middle schools in Mexico called <em>telesecundarias</em>. The subsystem was designed to reach communities with very few students where having one teacher for each of the major academic areas was, according to accepted political economy, not feasible. In most <em>telesecundarias</em> there is one teacher per grade, but not infrequently, in places with fewer students, two and even just one teacher have to take care of all grades. To make up for the service&rsquo;s structural deficiency, master classes on all academic subjects of the official curriculum are broadcast from headquarters, rigorously scheduled to appear daily on the TV set in every classroom. Incomplete <em>telesecundarias</em>, those with just two or one teacher, became the ideal place to renew the innovation recently suppressed in CONAFE. Teaching and learning in tutorial relationships would rescue vexed teachers, unable to master all topics and also profit from broadcast lectures. The basic demand of tutorial relationships deftly solved the predicament of these teachers, as they would offer their students only themes they felt comfortable with, and each student would choose according to his or her interest. Teachers would become tutors and engage in dialogue with each student. Progressively, each student would also become a tutor and tutors themselves become apprentices of freely chosen challenging subjects--assuming that all tutors had mastered well a few subjects. A research grant from the Educational Reform in Latin America Program (PREAL) made it possible to introduce the innovation in eight incomplete <em>telesecundarias</em> of two states, Zacatecas and Chihuahua (C&aacute;mara et al., 2006). Contrary to CONAFE practice, where the Post-Primary innovation was solely decided by the gatekeeper, in Zacatecas and Chihuahua the teaching and learning in tutorial relationships had, first, to be negotiated with an array of local authorities and then freely offered to interested teachers. Incomplete <em>telesecundarias</em> were so far behind academically, and so out of sync with the rest of the schools, that concerned authorities easily allowed what seemed to be a limited innovation; more so, since the promoters&rsquo; credentials were acceptable and their financing came from abroad. Demonstrative workshops were offered to prospective teachers, and those who signed up received intensive training sessions in tutorial relationships. The core tenet of the training was to eliminate the separation between trainers and implementers, so as to organize from the beginning ongoing learning communities. Trainers had to demonstrate the same competency that was expected from the teachers. In turn, the teachers had to be models for their students. The themes offered in the workshop were the same ones teachers would later offer their students, and most crucially, the manner of learning had to be personal, face to face, in dialogue between tutor and tutee&ndash;just as it had been during the training sessions. What ensued proved the efficacy and accessibility of the innovation to turn awkward educational places into vibrant learning communities. The visible success in the first <em>telesecundarias</em> attracted other teachers in Zacatecas and in a neighboring state. The news reached the National Undersecretary of Education who made a special trip to visit a <em>telesecundaria</em> run by a single teacher, Sara Mor&aacute;n. Impressed by the manifest transformation of teacher and students where one least expected to find educational excellence, the Undersecretary decided, as great gatekeeper, to invite all <em>telesecundaria</em> departments to a national workshop conducted by teachers and students of Zacatecas and San Lu&iacute;s Potos&iacute;. The practice thus became dependent on the decision of state gatekeepers, on the one hand, and on the perceived personal and academic benefits of the tutorial practice. Soon the Undersecretary accelerated the expansion of the practice by deciding that the over nine thousand basic education schools in the country, which in 2009 had scored the lowest point averages in the national standard test, should be trained and helped to improve by means of tutorial relationships. Even if participation for those schools was compulsory, the very nature of tutoring ensured free participation in the core unit of any learning process: the themes had to be freely accepted by the learner. The efficacy of the innovation was demonstrated by its acceptance by most teachers and students, despite the quasi-punitive character of the program. Moreover, outside educators came to see the practice, became apprentices to students and, convinced of the value of the innovation, took it back to their own places. As for external evaluation, the national standard test that is applied to all schools showed remarkable differences in those schools that had received regular technical support in tutorial relationships. The most dramatic changes occurred in <em>telesecundarias</em> that moved from the lowest point average among all categories of middle schools in the country, to the level of the highest ranking: the point average of private schools attended by students of affluent families (Azuma A., 2016; Meixi, 2018; Rinc&oacute;n-Gallardo, 2016).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As proof of the fact that innovation in public schools crucially depends on the wisdom and political context of gatekeepers, the administrators that arrived with the new government in 2012, found tutoring inadmissible, not so much for its educational merits as for having been promoted by an adversary administration whose every trace had to be erased. Yet, what happened in the following years became the most egregious evaluation of the transformative power of tutorial relations in schools, because many teachers and students continued the practice as independent professionals, without resources or administrative support, some even facing bureaucratic opposition. This fact allows for a radical new perspective with regard to the power of gatekeepers to determine what tutors and tutees should learn and how they should proceed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most recent experience (2016-2018) of introducing tutorial networks in public schools happened again in CONAFE, their place of origin. The views of the newly arrived gatekeeper in 2015 were congenial with tutorial practice, mainly because it had by then gained sufficient credibility among functionaries and educators. Actually, as a former state secretary of education in the state of Hidalgo, the new director had had the chance to meet in a small community a student who spontaneously told him about what she had learned and enjoyed as the apprentice of a fellow student. It was not difficult for the director to call experienced practitioners of <em>tutor&iacute;a</em> and entrust them, not just to help with a particularly vulnerable group, but take responsibility for a whole educational institution in charge of 32,000 community schools in the country. Except for the short-lived Post-Primary experience many years before, the educational model of CONAFE had been traditionally designed by outside experts, to be executed according to scripted guides that young high school graduates, enabled as &ldquo;instructors,&rdquo; strictly followed in their very small communities. This highly unorthodox educational arrangement was accepted, because full fledged teachers would rarely accept living in remote places to teach a handful of children. Acting on the innermost core of learning, tutoring turned on its head the role of CONAFE trainers and instructors, from being followers of scripted guides to becoming teachers of the particular subject matter each one of them had learned and about which he or she was able to engage in creative dialogue with students. Learning became alive and visible; subject matter was reinvented in every encounter; intellectual achievement was manifest; and, in a community of learners, service and affection progressively became the norm. The process experienced ebbs and flows during the two school periods it took to be fully implemented, mostly because of the accommodations CONAFE was asked to make in order to satisfy national demands about content and grading. The accommodation to traditional school practice that most interfered with tutoring was the "need" to cover standard programs in specific periods of time. Another major obstacle was just the immensity of the enterprise: 32,000 communities of pre-, elementary and middle schools, with over 40,000 temporary instructors. The young instructors served for only one or two school terms, after which they received scholarships to pursue their personal careers. Their training took place in a long summer course, but the most difficult part proved to be the follow- up, scattered as the instructors were in remote rural communities. Yet, many of them managed to radically improve learning in their communities. Within CONAFE, both at the central and state offices, a new pattern of relations began to take place. Indeed, from deputy directors, down to lower rank members, teaching and learning had to be practiced on an equal footing, thereby democratizing the group, while maintaining the line of authority in administrative matters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The extent and visibility of the innovation in CONAFE, markedly different from the educational reform being enacted simultaneously at the national level, has provoked both praise and criticism. The debate continues. Critics balance the praise that some experts have manifested after seeing the innovation up close, with the somewhat average performance of students in the most recent national standard test. Notwithstanding the short time span of the innovation, the number and difficult geography of the community centers, and the natural deep point in the first stage of any innovation, objections still weigh heavily in the minds of some administrators. At this point, and keeping in mind the many teachers in regular schools that continue on their own practicing <em>tutoria</em>, we though it convenient to make better known to present and future gatekeepers of the system the depth and magnitude of the personal and academic changes that the elemental practice of <em>tutoria</em> produces, independently of place or social context. This is the origin and intent of making accessible the recorded video interviews of satisfied teachers, students and their families.</p>
