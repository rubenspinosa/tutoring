<div  id="intro">
	<article>
		<p>Tutoring and learning communities (Redes de Tutor&iacute;a) in public schools began as an experiment, more than 20 years ago, in the small towns of Mexico, where the National Council for the Promotion of Education (CONAFE) opened Post-Primary centers (C&aacute;mara, 2003); a long overdue service, since only pre- and elementary school levels were usually offered in those places. Afterwards, tutorial practice continued with the support of the Under-Secretariat of Basic Education in incomplete tele-secondary schools (small middle schools, monitored by a single teacher, aided by satellite transmitted master classes) in several states. This system was later to expand massively, in the second half of the 2006-2012 federal administration, to the 9,000 elementary and secondary schools with the lowest grade point averages in the national standard achievement test (ENLACE). (Meixi, 2018; Rinc&oacute;n-Gallardo, 2016). At present, many teachers maintain the practice, even without official approval and support, both in incomplete (one teacher for all or several grades) and complete schools, because of the perceived improvement in their professional satisfaction, and in the academic and social achievements of their students. However, since the school year 2015-2016, CONAFE officially adopted tutorial practice under the model ABCD (Learning Based on Collaboration and Dialogue). Both in discourse and practice, the ABCD model has permeated the entire institution &ndash;directors, heads of programs, coordinators and trainers, down to the instructors in 32,000 small community schools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leading school researchers have written about the practice and foreign educators who came to experience it have taken the model back to their countries: notably Thailand and Chile, the USA for a time, and most recently, Argentina. In 2017 and 2018 the HundrEd Foundation of Finland included tutoring and learning communities among the 100 most promising educational innovations worldwide. At the beginning of 2018 the Inter-American Development Bank organized an international seminar to discuss <em>tutoria</em> in Mexico City and a second one this October in Guadalajara.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Tutoria</em>&rsquo;s basic <em>a priori</em> conviction is that teaching is a friendly encounter between equals, irrespective of the fact that one knows what the other wants to learn. Throughout the years we have developed an effective, accessible way, for any teacher of basic education to implement tutorial relations among her/his students. Tutoring becomes a simple, even minimal, intervention in schools, capable of producing extraordinary results and desirable educational outcomes. The efficacy of the practice does not depend on external factors-&ndash;buildings, equipment, educational materials, social conditions, etc.&mdash;though these are desirable and even legally enforceable. All it takes is for a teacher, with the approval of local authorities and the means to travel, to demonstrate the practice to a fellow teacher who knows about it and wants to try it out. What the first teacher delivers is, in effect, a very practical solution to two of the most urgent needs experienced by all teachers in multi-grade schools: the means to overcome the insecurity inherent in the demand to handle the different topics of a standard program, and the impossibility of being able to take care of each individual student so that no one is left out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tutor does the unexpected by asking the apprentice-teacher to choose among a variety of problems or topics which the tutor has mastered. The tutee is encouraged to select by himself/herself which of the topics or problems offered she/he wants and needs to learn in order to master them and overcome previous insecurities. In the tutorial dialogue, the apprentice uncovers what she/he already knows and connects it to what at the beginning seemed distant and/or inaccessible. The mastering of a problem or theme turns the apprentice-teacher into a professionally assured and satisfied tutor in a few but well mastered subjects. Quite an accomplishment, indeed, for a lonesome, overburdened and generally unmotivated teacher. The apprentice-teacher reflects on the tutorial process, effectively dispelling insecurities, reaffirming what was learned and thus discovers ways to effectively help each of his/her students in turn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this, a critic might say, is fine, but how can a single teacher provide personal tutoring to a large group of students? The answer is to stop thinking that only one person has the monopoly of teaching, and to recognize that all students are capable not only of learning, but also of teaching. Once a theme or topic has been mastered and reflected upon, the teacher-apprentice can become a tutor to whoever is interested in learning it. By doing so, the teacher not only deepens his or her own understanding of the particular theme, but also discovers different ways of approaching it, and most importantly, learns to appreciate different attitudes and dispositions among student-learners. From then on, the teacher&rsquo;s practice becomes more professional to the extent that she/he will be able to detect the students&rsquo; inner needs and help them learn by themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over and above the approving nod of authorities, the availability of time and the resources for travel, the fundamental work of the teacher-tutor will depend on the energy of each person, which, in fact, is the best distributed resource in the world. It is this energy that allows anyone to learn with interest and for personal advantage, to expand understanding and create community. Being so valuable, it is nevertheless free, always at hand, available to all. The willingness and the ability to learn is what any public educational service, especially in multi-grade schools, can and should achieve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tutorial practice follows a general sequence, indicative but not prescriptive, so as to accommodate to varied situations and individuals, and open always to surprise.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Origin</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As stated above, educational change took place in incomplete schools with few or only one teacher --at the margins of a public service which manages to reach the poorest communities, but where distance and poverty make compliance to normal school regulations difficult, and where both teachers and students face daily academic chores without the expectation, encouragement and social pressure of urban families. In conditions of bare subsistence, only a genuine interest to learn can attract and maintain a student's attention, and only a worthy academic offering can provide meaning to the teacher&rsquo;s effort. Interest becomes the indispensable and definitive factor to produce the desired change in teachers and students.</p>
<p>The basic intent of a service that reaches out to the poorest regions is to provide the younger generation with the means to be informed and capable of acting in the contemporary world. However, a recent study by the National Institute of Educational Evaluation, demonstrates that the service has generally been a failure, since two thirds of the students in the last year of high school cannot correctly answer a sufficient number of questions in a national standard test (SEP, 2017).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What Redes de Tutoria concludes is that the educational and human waste is due to the impersonal character of the service, which does not provide the time nor the attention necessary to follow the interests, conditions and dispositions of every teacher and student. It should be obvious that the orientation towards taking account of each person&rsquo;s interest comes from basic personal experience of what learning is, rather than from educational learning theories. The way we all learn to move, talk, walk, trust and live in the surroundings of family and society is a continuation, in its own scale, of the millennial drive to learn, moved by inner interest, exerting the inborn gift of language, through which culture is constantly inherited and re-created. The evolution and subsistence of the human family is irrefutable proof that, by communicating--most usually through the spoken word--all of us are capable of learning and teaching. There is no doubt that what we learn informally in our families, and in society at large, is generally worthwhile; doubts arise more frequently, however, about what is learned in formal institutions and contexts, whether public or private, even family operated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This common-sense perspective allows us to see more clearly the source of the alienation that befalls scores of students. It is not because of their negligence or laziness, but because they are not getting the attention that their situations require and demand. All humans want to learn and to survive. Most students in traditional formal settings get used to impersonal, imposed relationships. Sometimes, however, those suffering alienation can be fortunate enough to uncover the obvious disfunction: like the child in Andersen&rsquo;s fable that cried out that the King was naked. The formal setting ceases being alienating the moment someone close to the student attends to her or his particular interests and respects the many ways that lead to learning. Educators must straighten out the formal settings &ndash;or turn them upside down&mdash; by responding to each student&rsquo;s particular interests and making sure that school content, times and modes of learning accommodate to the student, and not the other way around.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The origin of the approach to take advantage of the margins of the school system in order to try straightening it out, rests on the deep conviction of the promoters that attending to particular learning interests and fostering freedom and variety are paramount to provide an effective educational service in formal education settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In time, the original approach became strengthened by contributions of well-known authors and critics of conventional schooling, echoed today by more recent authors who are convinced that content, times and mode of learning should always follow the interests of teachers and students, over against what has been--and still is now--the prevailing practice, in which learning is made a function of the content, time and mode defined by groups of experts and administrators, rather than by the interests of those needing and wanting to learn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Important as it is to explain the origin of the practice, it is also convenient to explain the rationality of the sequence through which the practice has evolved and coalesced, so that its essentials can be understood and its diffusion can continue. The sequence is just a memory aid for those interested and actively engaged in the practice, not a conceptual shortcut by which one could dispense with the practice and hope to obtain the same results. The sequence has the merit of presenting schematically those central aspects that lay out and, in a way, ensure the power and variety of tutorial relationships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rationality of the sequence &ndash;its <em>natural</em> character, heeding the famous Latin induction to <em>follow Nature as our guide</em>&mdash;can be understood and accepted in reference to the judgment of well-known authors. In them we have found affinity, instruction and support, as we promote learning in tutorial relationships. Our major debt is to critics of contemporary educational systems in the second half of the 20th century: Paul Goodman, Ivan Illich, John Holt, Paulo Freire, Carl Rogers. Not only in the Anglo-Saxon world, but also throughout the Spanish and Portuguese world their writings have been amply discussed by local thinkers and educators. In particular, the sequence profits from theoretical elaborations by David Hawkins, philosopher, Seymour Sarason, psychologist, and Richard Elmore, expert on processes of educational change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Interest</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seymour Sarason, distinguished Yale researcher, repeatedly expressed, with scientific precision, the role interest plays in any learning situation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Learning is a process that takes place in an interpersonal context, in which powerful factors like motivation, understanding, affection, reflection and the like, are always present. Of the many factors that intervene and modify the process, the strength of willing to learn may well be the most fateful. </em>(Sarason, 1996).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elsewhere Sarason refers to interest as the quintessential, indispensable, element in any learning situation. Common experience tells us that of all we learned in formal institutions what remains alive is what was learned with interest. Otherwise, what remains, if at all, is a vague nominal memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Education from the point of view of equality, liberty and rationality; defining positive traits of human interaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be congruent with the learning that started in infancy, any educational service should be personal, and therefore, a dialogue of equals. Tutoring, in which two engage in earnest dialogue must, indeed, be personal. The equality in a tutorial dialogue corresponds to the incommensurability of humans, individually different, but capable of reaching consensus &ndash;of identifying reality&mdash; at the margin of idiosyncrasies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a dialogue, any hierarchy due to the tutor&rsquo;s knowledge and the tutee&rsquo;s ignorance is but transitory, because the joy of the tutor will be to see knowledge realized in the learner. What deeply identifies tutor and tutee, willing to share knowledge in an honest meeting, is their openness and mutual respect, to the point of rendering irrelevant to their endeavor whatever differences may exist in terms of race, ethnicity, age, complexion or ideology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The freedom to choose topics and themes, and defining the particular challenge within the apprentice&rsquo;s cultural realm, will allow him/her to direct the search and proceed autonomously. He/she will be the constant and definitive judge of the truth, beauty and goodness of what is being learned in dialogue with the tutor. Any apprentice is both a receptor of culture and a contributor to it; hence the need to respect choices, rhythms, doubts and deviations, knowing that to learn means being always ready for surprises.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Creativity, for the one who learns with genuine interest and proceeds autonomously, implies stretching human faculties. In the absence of clear guiding referents, the learner experiences an intelligible intuition and finds order in what at the beginning was a puzzling challenge. In this manner, the tutee recreates his or her cultural realm, though provisionally, always prepared to continue learning. The corollary of the above is for tutors not to facilitate direct answers to the puzzle the tutees face, otherwise the effort diminishes, and so will their achievement and satisfaction, which is the natural outcome of good learning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The creativity with which the tutee finds order where before there was confusion springs from the power of the intuitive synthesis, the reflective judgement proper to the rational mind. The effort to see, remove obstacles, explore ways and choose paths will always depend on the learner&rsquo;s interests and commitment, but when the synthesis occurs, understanding becomes imperative, without the intervention of the person&rsquo;s will. This intuitive synthesis remains a mystery to neuroscientists. As the linguist Noam Chomsky has put it: &ldquo;we know a lot about the puppet [neuroscience&rsquo;s findings], but nothing about the puppeteer [the intuitive synthesis]."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The process by which tutor and tutee assimilate as well as generate knowledge arises from the general culture within which both operate, and to which they also contribute. Besides, they add the cultural refinement of public expression in speech and in the written word. Finally, a cultural debt is paid every time apprentices become tutors and share with others the value of autonomous learning, mastered with sustained effort, reflectively analyzed and carefully prepared so as to be able to share it with professional accuracy. The educational cycle reaches completion when learning becomes habit and teaching is commonplace. Tutoring others not only affirms the reality, visibility and usefulness of what was learned, it also creates empathy and conviviality. Dialogue implies that two persons recognize one another as equals. Consequently, the implicit and most profound understanding that results from tutoring is the recognition that being human means sharing origins and destinies.</p>
