</h2>
<div  id="intro">
	<article>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our task has been the relentless promotion of a different type of relationship between teachers and students in basic public schools. Tutoring is different from the standard classroom where one teacher is in charge of a large group of students, all bound to learn under his/her direction what a national program has decided. The common experience of the way learning takes place in a family, from early infancy and later in convivial settings, tells us that we succeed in learning what is of real interest to us, provided we receive help from knowledgeable and loving persons. It was to promote this type of learning in regular schools, that we conceived of and developed tutorial practices. We were convinced that many of the shortcomings that people criticize in our educational system are due to the lack of attention given to the particular interests of teachers and students. &nbsp;Considering the disaffection, the low academic achievement and frustration in the case of those students who drop out, we can conclude that their school experience must have been one of loneliness and intellectual estrangement. It is an intolerable waste that capable students should miss the opportunity to learn, but it is even more wasteful that, while in school, they also missed the opportunity to know, respect and support one another. Tutoring takes place in classrooms not only between teachers and students, but also between students who have learned something and their fellow students willing to learn the same topic. Learning communities are networks of learners and teachers, that interact according to each person&rsquo;s interest and/or capacity. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The academic and social achievements of tutor&iacute;a can be demonstrated in several ways, not only in the increases in point averages on standard tests, but more so by the communality and solidarity students practice in school, in their families and in the educational institutions in which many continue studying. The extension of tutorial practices to other schools, even to other countries, and the recognition expressed by experts and international groups attest to the advantages of teaching and learning in a community of equals. Recently we began recording interviews with students, teachers and members of their families who, either had experienced tutor&iacute;a at some point, or were actively practicing tutor&iacute;a in the present. In doing the interviews, our intent was to provide an opportunity for those not yet acquainted with the practice to experience it as vividly as possible, like those who have received tutor&iacute;a, not from a teacher but from one of the students. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The video recordings reveal how simple and accessible to all, old or young, is the practice of tutor&iacute;a, but they also reveal its power, as evident in the persuasion and enthusiasm with which the interviewed discuss and recommend it. It is quite extraordinary that the same positive educational narrative about the practice appears in the testimonials of students of incomplete middle-schools in the state of Zacatecas as well as in the reactions of promoters and trainers of the National Council for the Promotion of Education, who are responsible for education in most of the remote and impoverished small Mexican communities. It is also worth noting that what the tutor&iacute;a practitioners have undoubtedly accomplished is just what the national public service expects for every student under its care. </span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>The context of the study</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to obtain a rich qualitative description of the impact of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">tutor&iacute;a </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">in school communities, we conducted interviews with teachers, teacher coaches, students, alumni and parents who had experienced this learning relationship in some way. The participants come from two settings: telesecundarias --rural middle schools-- from the state of Zacatecas in northern Mexico, and rural schools of the National Council for the Promotion of Education (in Spanish Consejo Nacional de Fomento Educativo, CONAFE) in four states of central and southern Mexico.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of the middle schools in Zacatecas, the interviewees include teachers who have practiced </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">tutor&iacute;a </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">in their school as well as students, alumni, and parents who, in the teachers&rsquo; view, have benefitted from their participation in </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">tutor&iacute;a</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Altogether, the analysis includes 15 interviews to students, 30 to alumni, 12 to teachers and teacher coaches, and 6 to parents. The participants come from 11 communities of the state of Zacatecas</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The teachers had worked with tutor&iacute;a between less than a year and over ten years and varied in gender, work experience, and intensity of their tutor&iacute;a practice. Some used it on a daily basis, as the main learning modality; others as a complement to conventional classes. The majority of students and alumni ranged between two months and three years of experience with tutor&iacute;a. Four of the interviewees were professors or students from the Teachers College of the State of Zacatecas who had interned at tutor&iacute;a-practicing secondary schools. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of CONAFE, the analysis comprises interviews with 3 teacher and teacher coaches from the state of Puebla, 3 from the state of Hidalgo, one from the state of Tlaxcala and one from the state of Veracruz. All interviewees had first-hand experience as either teachers or participant observers in CONAFE&rsquo;s rural schools. These interviewees had between two and three years of experience as tutor&iacute;a practitioners. </span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Methodology </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The interviews were conducted by members of the promoting team of Redes de Tutor&iacute;a in three moments: September 2017 and April-May 2018 in the case of Zacatecas, and June 2018 in the case of CONAFE. The interview format was unstructured to ensure a range of personal and academic situations could be captured. The theme of the interviews was the impact of tutor&iacute;a --both at an academic and personal level-- as perceived by the participants. They were encouraged to share their experiences and to support their claims with details and examples.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a first stage of analysis, the interviews were transcribed and analyzed for evidence of personal and academic change as a consequence of the respondents&rsquo; involvement with tutor&iacute;a. After analyzing a first batch of ten interviews, the team agreed on the following general areas of impact: autonomy, conviviality and community participation, cognitive abilities and psicosocial abilities. Each of these categories was further broken down into subcategories to allow for a finer analysis. At the next stage, all interviews were coded for these categories and subcategories, and frequencies were obtained. Finally, some interview excerpts were selected and arranged for this chapter.</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Overview of results</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of the four main categories -community and conviviality, autonomy, psychosocial abilities, and cognitive abilities- appeared in at least 55 out of the 71 coded interviews -which represents a 78.87%</span></p>
