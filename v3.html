	<article>
		<p>This publication, modest in appearance and extension, compared to those previously issued by our group--now known as Redes de Tutoría—is particularly relevant at the present moment in Mexico, in order to advance faster in the educational change that has already taken root among many teachers of small rural public schools. The publication vividly embodies, through recorded testimonials, the personal and social changes experienced and voiced by alumni, students, teachers and family members who taught and learned--all of them--in tutorial relationships. Their achievements are truly remarkable, because they occurred in ordinary, even supposedly adverse, settings, with the help of not particularly expert teachers, and without additional teaching technologies or materials. What was decisive was that the personal interest of each learner matched the care and knowledge of her/his tutor. The matching of interest and capacity ensured the success of the endeavor and, in addition, became the basic bond within communities of teachers and learners. 
</p><br>
		<p>The driving force of what can be described as a movement has been the newly found professional autonomy of teachers, who traditionally find themselves limited by institutional distrust and the ensuing overregulation and control. The experience of being attended to in regular training sessions, and of being asked to decide by themselves the topic of study each one wants to pursue, engaging in dialogue with friendly and knowledgeable tutors, renewed in them the joy of teaching and learning in freedom. They each chose a particular aspect of the program, because it was of real interest to them, or because they had never really mastered it; they explored it at their own pace, and in their own way as never before. All of this took place in constant dialogue with an interested, trusted and kind tutor. Moreover, the satisfaction of personal achievement increased as teachers reflected on the way they had learned.  They then shared their experiences with others and--in order to affirm and prove the worth of what they had learned--became tutors of the same topics to other teachers- apprentices.</p><br>
		
		<p>What teaching and learning in tutorial networks demonstrate is that the culture of school and the problem of change, as Seymour Sarason (2004) put it, is more related to ethical rather than to technical aspects.  They are more about personal, honest and truthful relationships than about programs, teacher-student ratios, material resources or state-of-the-art technologies. Paradoxically, what prevents the normal encounter of interested learners with caring and honest tutors is the traditional structure of a system in which learning is made a function of programs, schedules and methods decided by an external authority, rather than by the learners themselves. In a learning community, by contrast, content, times and methods are transformed into functions of what the learner and the tutor need, and are capable of doing. Experience shows that this simple, common sense approach goes against the grain of accepted practice in most schools. Therefore, we feel obliged to explain and promote this practice, which is satisfactory for students, teachers, parents and, indeed, for society at large. The best, most productive way to disseminate the practice has been by contagion, by participation in a learning community, becoming apprentices and wholeheartedly experiencing the tutorial cycle. In this publication, we offer a second best: the vicarious experience of the transformative nature of teaching and learning in tutorial networks, in videos and recorded interviews of people who manifest and explain their deep personal, emotional and intellectual transformation through the practice. </p><br>
